            1. The application is based on Ethereum Blockchain and hence is a public ledger application, I understand all my contract details will be publicly visible.

            <br>
            <br>

            2. The application is just a POC (proof-of-concept) showcasing the capabilities of Digital Smart Contracts, I understand that these contacts do not have any legal standings and cannot be used in any government trials and procedures as proof.

            <br>
            <br>

            3. The application is designed as per the rental guidelines of Delhi Government and all the charges including Rent, Security and Registration Fees are calculated in Indian Rupees (INR). 

            <br>
            <br>

            4. Currently, the Smart Contracts are uploaded on Ropsten TestNet and the owner of the Contract is the creator (Anudish Jain), no real life assets are currently being used for transactions on this application just Test Coins of Zero Monetary Value.

            <br>
            <br>

            5. I understand that the future versions will have governments as the SOLE OWNERS of these contracts designing and implementing the new guidelines, I will help support this platform by only uploading authenticate and accurate data.

            <br>
            <br>

            6. I will be required to use MetaMask or any other Ethereum Wallet for interacting with this application and will be using the same for future interactions with this application.<br> Read below to know How..
